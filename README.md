## Compiling the Program
To compile the program simply load the 'build.xml' file to ant and select the main tag.

Alternatively you can use:
```
ant -buildfile build.xml
```

## Running the Program
- To run the program, simply click on the jar file created by the 'build.xml' file to run it.\
Alternatively you can use: 
    ```
    java -jar Monopoly.jar
    ```
- Once the program is loaded select: ```File -> New Board```
- From there you can choose your desired board config to load.
- You can also load any of your previous saved games using: ```File -> Load Board```

For a detailed explanation of how to run the program please refer to the [user manual](https://github.com/bardia-p/Monopoly-Simulator/blob/master/documents/UserManual.pdf).

## Making Custom Boards
You can customize the board however you want!

Make sure you follow the .xml templates under the [board_config](https://github.com/bardia-p/Monopoly-Simulator/tree/master/board_config) folder. Once you have created your xml file, it will appear under the drop down menu upon reloading the game. 

You have the option of adding images to each cell:
1. If you choose to add images to the cell:
    - Create a directory for your new config under the src directory to include your images.
    - Make sure to add the proper ```<image></image>``` tag with the proper relative path for each path.
    - You can look at [rick_and_morty_images_config](https://github.com/bardia-p/Monopoly-Simulator/blob/master/board_config/rick_morty_board_images.xml) as an example.

    </p>
2. If you choose not to include any images, the program will generate the invidual cells based on the information that you have provided.
    - You can look at [rick_and_morty_config](https://github.com/bardia-p/Monopoly-Simulator/blob/master/board_config/rick_morty_board.xml) as an example.

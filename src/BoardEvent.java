/**
 * Group 3
 * SYSC 3110 - Milestone 2 BoardEvent Class
 *
 * This document is the BoardEvent. This class has a BoardModel.Status type, a player, a value, a list of commands, a
 * result, a board cell, the recent roll, and a list of players.
 *
 * The class is the main point of contact between the BoardModel and the BoardListener. The current status of the board
 * is packaged inside of an event and is passed to the listener which is then either handled internally by the listener
 * or passed on to the controller.
 *
 * Events can come in different forms containing different kinds of information which is the reason why this class has a
 * lot of constructors.
